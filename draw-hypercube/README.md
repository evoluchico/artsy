# draw-hypercube 

Draw a hypercube and spin it in the X, Y, Z, and W dimensions, by changing the angles in different planes: XY, XZ, XW, etc.

After attending the [Dimensions](https://www.ashmolean.org/event/dimensions-the-mathematics-of-symmetry-and-space) exhibit, by the Ashmolean Museum and Oxford's Mathematical Institute, I decided to make my own interactive hypercube.

That also involved learning a lot more about [n-dimensional rotation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix).
